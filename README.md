# 🗳️ Privavote

**Privavote** is a privacy-preserving voting system built using **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** to ensure that votes remain secure, anonymous, and tamper-proof — without relying on any central authority.

## 🔒 Why Privavote?

Traditional digital voting systems often require voters to place trust in a central server or third party. Privavote eliminates this need by using **MPC**, allowing a group of entities to compute the election result **without revealing individual votes**.

This makes it ideal for:

- DAO Governance
- Academic Council Voting
- Election Audits
- Decentralized Organizations
- Privacy-focused communities

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core logic and MPC orchestration
- **Cryptography** – Secure key handling and encrypted messaging
- **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** – Secret-sharing and trustless result computation
- *(Optional integration-ready)* Smart Contract layer for transparency and verifiability

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving**: No one sees individual votes — not even the system
- ✅ **Verifiable Computation**: Final results are publicly verifiable
- 🧩 **Modular**: Easily extendable to support various voting protocols
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast**: Ideal for small teams or large communities
